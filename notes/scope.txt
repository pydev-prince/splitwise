3. Settlement Intelligence (You’re Halfway There)

    You already have settlement CRUD. Good.

    What’s missing:

    POST /api/v1/groups/{group_id}/settlements/auto
    GET  /api/v1/groups/{group_id}/settlements/pending


    Auto-settlement:

    Computes minimum number of payments

    Graph optimization problem

    Huge interview brownie points

    Pending settlements:

        Real UX need

        Distinguishes planned vs executed money flow

5. Audit & History APIs (This Is Senior Thinking)

    Money systems never forget.

    Add:

    GET /api/v1/groups/{group_id}/activity-log
    GET /api/v1/users/me/activity


    Track:

    Expense added

    Expense edited

    Settlement done/undone

    User joined/exited group

    Don’t overbuild. Even basic logs impress.

6. Idempotency & Safety (Very Rare in Fresher Projects)

    Add:

    POST /api/v1/expenses (Idempotent)
    POST /api/v1/settlements (Idempotent)


    Via:

    Idempotency-Key header

    If the same request hits twice:

    No duplicate expense

    No duplicate settlement

    Mention this once in an interview → instant credibility.

7. System-Level APIs (Production Awareness)

    You already have:

    GET /system/health/db


    Add:

    GET /api/v1/system/health
    GET /api/v1/system/metrics


    Metrics can expose:

    Total users

    Total groups

    Total expenses

    Simple counts. Big signal.

8. Notifications (Optional, Resume Gold)

    Even fake it.

    GET /api/v1/notifications
    POST /api/v1/notifications/mark-read


    Trigger on:

    Expense added involving user

    Settlement request

    You don’t need real emails. Store them in DB.
