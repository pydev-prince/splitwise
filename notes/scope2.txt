3. Multi-Currency Support (Optional, High Impact)

    Even basic support:

    Store currency per group

    Enforce same currency per group

    Advanced:

        Exchange rate snapshot at expense time

        You don’t need conversion logic. Just design for it.

        Design > implementation here.

5. Expense Types (Real Use Case)

    Add:

    Equal split

    Exact amount

    Percentage

    Shares (1:2:3)

    Even if backend-only, it shows domain understanding.

6. Offline / Retry Safety (Hidden Quality)

    Assume:

    Mobile client retries requests

    Network drops mid-request

    Add:

        Idempotency keys

        Transaction boundaries

        If you use DB transactions correctly, say it proudly.

8. Data Ownership & Privacy

    Add rules:

        You can’t view expenses of a group you’re not in

        You can’t see balances of others outside shared groups

        Explicit checks. No assumptions.

        Security is a feature.

9. Export & Reporting (Simple but Impressive)

    Add:

    GET /api/v1/groups/{group_id}/export


    Return:

    JSON or CSV

    Expenses + settlements

    This is practical and shows product thinking.

10. Feature You Should Add ONLY If Time Allows

    Pick one:

        Expense comments

        Tags (travel, food, rent)

        Monthly summaries

        Debt simplification graph

    One is enough. Don’t go Pokémon mode.

11. Final Resume-Level Polish (Not Code)

    Document:

        Balance algorithm

        Settlement minimization logic

        Tradeoffs you made

        What you’d do with more time

        Interviewers care about how you think, not feature count.
